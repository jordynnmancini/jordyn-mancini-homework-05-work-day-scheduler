# Homework 05: Work Day Scheduler

## My Task

The goal was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to enter in tasks for each hour of the work day, and save each task to Local Storage. If the user navigates away from the page and then comes back, anything they've saved to Local Storage will render on the screen.  

## The Process

The starter code consisted of HTML and CSS, and I started by adding divs to the HTML to represent time blocks for each hour of the work day (9am - 5pm). I then created a Javascript file powered by JQuery. The Javascript allows the user to enter in tasks they need to complete for each hour, and then save to Local Storage. The time blocks are color-coded depending on the time of day - green if it's in the future, red if it's present, or grey if it's in the past.

## Demonstration 

This screen recording was taken at 12:35pm on February 27th. As you can see, the blocks of time before 12pm are grey to show they were in the past, 12pm is red to show present, and the future time blocks are green.
